    For example, to enable GitHub Advanced Security, use this data in the body of the `PATCH` request:
    `{ "security_and_analysis": {"advanced_security": { "status": "enabled" } } }`.
    
    You can check which security and analysis features are currently enabled by using a `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` request.
    * hasIssues: Either `true` to enable issues for this repository or `false` to disable them.
    * hasProjects: Either `true` to enable projects for this repository or `false` to disable them. **Note:** If you're creating a repository in an organization that has disabled repository projects, the default is `false`, and if you pass `true`, the API returns an error.
    * hasWiki: Either `true` to enable the wiki for this repository or `false` to disable it.
    * isTemplate: Either `true` to make this repo available as a template repository or `false` to prevent it.

    * useSquashPrTitleAsDefault: Either `true` to allow squash-merge commits to use pull request title, or `false` to use commit message. **This property has been deprecated. Please use `squash_merge_commit_title` instead.
    * squashMergeCommitTitle: The default value for a squash merge commit title:
    
    - `PR_TITLE` - default to the pull request's title.
    - `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE` - default to the commit's title (if only one commit) or the pull request's title (when more than one commit).
